# CL-Anti-Public-Checker

to begin :

download the files from github and extract it into a folder
open console in you downloaded folder
type in npm install
type in node index.js to start

requirements :

you need to have a running mysql database (which you can simple create host with XAMPP).
i created in the test structure and table named acchash inside it a only one columm named hash.
thats it you can change the names ofc but you need to change them in the js file too.

If you found any issues feel free to make a pull request thanks

btw its for test purposes only how to check if a hashed sha256 value exists in the db
